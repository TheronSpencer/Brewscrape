# Brewscrape

For this project, a webscraper was developed to scrape beer recipes (69 total features) from https://www.brewersfriend.com/. After scraping the data, some basic exploratory data analysis was done. Eventually, this data will be used to create a beer style classifier as well as some neural network based recipe generator.
